# -BTR-Brain-Tumor-Recognition-via-MRI
In this project used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. I also employed Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model development. The model results demonstrated a validation accuracy of 91% and a test set accuracy of 89%.
